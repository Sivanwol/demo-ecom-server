# Cloud Support issues and feedback
<p>for the system better best to be on the infra of Google cloud as many elements are cloud based such as firebase (auth, database, hosting and more).
the server config mostly able support cloud via app engine but as lack time and funds this not tested or verify.
</p>

#### there is few known areas that will need support
- Media api - currently both code and storage are center as single server infra this need total rework and verify and check test see it matched
- Log system - ... need migrate this to google cloud logs system
- celery system - this may need refactor all of at or check solution that work with it to switch to google task system or different server


### Overall
<p>
Few areas that later need see what to do it is add better cd system perf github actions base system.
</p>
<p> need see how split the roles of the system to microservice with center config center </p>
